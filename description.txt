This Mod is the Successor of my 2 other mods "NPC Protector" and "Boss Controll"

Are you annoyed from a certain type of Enemy and want to get rid of them all forever?

Do you have a Dedicated Server and want more Control over NPCs?

Wanna prevent your Town-NPCs from dying everytime a friend of yours decides he wants to spawn that boss too close to the Town-NPCs?

Or do you want to prevent griefers in a public modded Server from starting hardmode by killing the wall of flesh?


Wanna have all that in combination with Ingame-Changeable settins without having to reload?


Then Oh-Boy do I have a Mod for you!


This Mod has 2 Main functions

1. It lets you disable any enemy Spawn you want 
2. You can make any Type of NPC invincible

And the best part?
It's compatible with HEROsMod! If it's detected to be installed on your Server, we add our own Permission to HEROsMods Permission System!


How do you configure the Mod?
Esc -> Settings -> Mod Settings -> NPC Control

You can add NPCs to one of the 2 lists by clicking the + and clicking on the empty field to choose an NPC

Or delete an NPC out of the lists by clicking the trashcan to the left of each NPC.
